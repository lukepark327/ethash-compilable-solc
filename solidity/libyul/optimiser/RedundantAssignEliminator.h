/**
 * Optimiser component that removes assignments to variables that are not used
 * until they go out of scope or are re-assigned. This component
 * respects the control-flow and takes it into account for removal.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * {
 *   let a
 *   a := 1
 *   a := 2
 *   b := 2
 *   if calldataload(0)
 *   {
 *     b := mload(a)
 *   }
 *   a := b
 * }
 *
 * In the example, "a := 1" can be removed because the value from this assignment
 * is not used in any control-flow branch (it is replaced right away).
 * The assignment "a := 2" is also overwritten by "a := b" at the end,
 * but there is a control-flow path (through the condition body) which uses
 * the value from "a := 2" and thus, this assignment cannot be removed.
 *
 * Detailed rules:
 *
 * The AST is traversed twice: in an information gathering step and in the
 * actual removal step. During information gathering, we maintain a
 * mapping from assignment statements to the three states
 * "unused", "undecided" and "used".
 * When an assignment is visited, it is added to the mapping in the "undecided" state
 * (see remark about for loops below) and every other assignment to the same variable
 * that is still in the "undecided" state is changed to "unused".
 * When a variable is referenced, the state of any assignment to that variable still
 * in the "undecided" state is changed to "used".
 * At points where control flow splits, a copy
 * of the mapping is handed over to each branch. At points where control flow
 * joins, the two mappings coming from the two branches are combined in the following way:
 * Statements that are only in one mapping or have the same state are used unchanged.
 * Conflicting values are resolved in the following way:
 * "unused", "undecided" -> "undecided"
 * "unused", "used" -> "used"
 * "undecided, "used" -> "used".
 *
 * For for-loops, the condition, body and post-part are visited twice, taking
 * the joining control-flow at the condition into account.
 * In other words, we create three control flow paths: Zero runs of the loop,
 * one run and two runs and then combine them at the end.
 * Running at most twice is enough because there are only three different states.
 *
 * For switch statements that have a "default"-case, there is no control-flow
 * part that skips the switch.
 *
 * When a variable goes out of scope, all statements still in the "undecided"
 * state are changed to "unused", unless the variable is the return
 * parameter of a function - there, the state changes to "used".
 *
 * In the second traversal, all assignments that are in the "unused" state are removed.
 *
 *
 * This step is usually run right after the SSA transform to complete
 * the generation of the pseudo-SSA.
 *
 * Prerequisite: Disambiguator.
