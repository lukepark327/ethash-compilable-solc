/**
 * Optimizer stage that tries to replace repeated assignments to
 * existing variables by declarations of new variables as much as
 * possible.
 * The reassignments are still there, but all references to the
 * reassigned variables are replaced by the newly declared variables.
 *
 * Example:
 * {
 *   let a := 1
 *   mstore(a, 2)
 *   a := 3
 * }
 * is transformed to
 * {
 *   let a_1 := 1
 *   let a := a_1
 *   mstore(a_1, 2)
 *   let a_3 := 3
 *   a := a_3
 * }
 *
 * Exact semantics:
 *
 * For any variable a that is assigned to somewhere in the code (assignment with
 * declaration does not count) perform the following transforms:
 *  - replace "let a := v" by "let a_1 := v   let a := a_1"
 *  - replace "a := v" by "let a_1 := v   a := a_1"
 * Furthermore, always note the current variable/value assigned to a and replace each
 * reference to a by this variable.
 * The current value mapping is cleared for a variable a at the end of each block
 * in which it was assigned and just after the for loop init block if it is assigned
 * inside the for loop.
 *
 * After this stage, redundantAssignmentRemover is recommended to remove the unnecessary
 * intermediate assignments.
 *
 * This stage provides best results if CSE is run right before it, because
 * then it does not generate excessive amounts of variables.
 *
 * TODO Which transforms are required to keep this idempotent?
