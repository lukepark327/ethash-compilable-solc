/**
 * Metric for the size of code.
 * More specifically, the number of AST nodes.
 * Ignores function definitions while traversing the AST by default.
 * If you want to know the size of a function, you have to invoke this on its body.
 *
 * As an exception, the following AST elements have a cost of zero:
 *  - expression statement (only the expression inside has a cost)
 *  - block (only the statements inside have a cost)
 *  - variable references
 *  - variable declarations (only the right hand side has a cost)
 *  - assignments (only the value has a cost)
 *
 * As another exception, each statement incurs and additional cost of one
 * per jump/branch. This means if, break and continue statements have a cost of 2,
 * switch statements have a cost of 1 plus the number of cases times two,
 * and for loops cost 3.
