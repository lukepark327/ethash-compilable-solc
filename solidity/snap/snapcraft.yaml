summary: The Solidity Contract-Oriented Programming Language
description: |
  Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar
  to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual
  Machine (EVM).

  Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex
  user-defined types among other features.

  It is possible to create contracts for voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions,
  multi-signature wallets and more.
