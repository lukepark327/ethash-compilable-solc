## Background

Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts
that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer
network where nobody has special authority over the execution and thus they allow to implement tokens of value,
ownership, voting and other kinds of logics.

## Build and Install

Instructions about how to build and install the Solidity compiler can be found in the [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source)


## Example

A "Hello World" program in Solidity is of even less use than in other languages, but still:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

contract HelloWorld {
  function helloWorld() external pure returns (string memory) {
    return "Hello, World!";
  }
}
```

To get started with Solidity, you can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), which is an
browser-based IDE. Here are some example contracts:

1. [Voting](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/solidity-by-example.html#voting)
2. [Blind Auction](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/solidity-by-example.html#blind-auction)
3. [Safe remote purchase](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/solidity-by-example.html#safe-remote-purchase)
4. [Micropayment Channel](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/solidity-by-example.html#micropayment-channel)
