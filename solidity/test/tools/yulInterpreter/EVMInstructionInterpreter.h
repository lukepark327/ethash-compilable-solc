/**
 * Interprets EVM instructions based on the current state and logs instructions with
 * side-effects.
 *
 * Since this is mainly meant to be used for differential fuzz testing, it is focused
 * on a single contract only, does not do any gas counting and differs from the correct
 * implementation in many ways:
 *
 * - If memory access to a "large" memory position is performed, a deterministic
 *   value is returned. Data that is stored in a "large" memory position is not
 *   retained.
 * - The blockhash instruction returns a fixed value if the argument is in range.
 * - Extcodesize returns a deterministic value depending on the address.
 * - Extcodecopy copies a deterministic value depending on the address.
 * - And many other things
 *
 * The main focus is that the generated execution trace is the same for equivalent executions
 * and likely to be different for non-equivalent executions.
