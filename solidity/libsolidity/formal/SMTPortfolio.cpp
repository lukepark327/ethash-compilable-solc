/*
 * Broadcasts the SMT query to all solvers and returns a single result.
 * This comment explains how this result is decided.
 *
 * When a solver is queried, there are four possible answers:
 *   SATISFIABLE (SAT), UNSATISFIABLE (UNSAT), UNKNOWN, CONFLICTING, ERROR
 * We say that a solver _answered_ the query if it returns either:
 *   SAT or UNSAT
 * A solver did not answer the query if it returns either:
 *   UNKNOWN (it tried but couldn't solve it) or ERROR (crash, internal error, API error, etc).
 *
 * Ideally all solvers answer the query and agree on what the answer is
 * (all say SAT or all say UNSAT).
 *
 * The actual logic as as follows:
 * 1) If at least one solver answers the query, all the non-answer results are ignored.
 *   Here SAT/UNSAT is preferred over UNKNOWN since it's an actual answer, and over ERROR
 *   because one buggy solver/integration shouldn't break the portfolio.
 *
 * 2) If at least one solver answers SAT and at least one answers UNSAT, at least one of them is buggy
 * and the result is CONFLICTING.
 *   In the future if we have more than 2 solvers enabled we could go with the majority.
 *
 * 3) If NO solver answers the query:
 *   If at least one solver returned UNKNOWN (where the rest returned ERROR), the result is UNKNOWN.
 *   This is preferred over ERROR since the SMTChecker might decide to abstract the query
 *   when it is told that this is a hard query to solve.
 *
 *   If all solvers return ERROR, the result is ERROR.
